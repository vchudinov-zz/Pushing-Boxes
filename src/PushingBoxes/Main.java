/** Pushing Boxes - The game where you...push boxes.
 * The goal of the game is to get all the boxes in the trapdoor.
 * Moving heavy boxes is not that easy, though, and when the player does it he loses energy.
 * Lose your energy and you lose a life. Unlike cats the player has only three lives before they lose the game
 * 
 * Note from Viktor: If you cannot run the game because of a 
 * library error right click on the project -> Add Library. 
 * Select the files in the lib subfolder of the project and add them.
 * In the run submenu in the field VM write 
 * -Djava.library.path=<path to your java projects folder>\PushingBoxes\src\Natives\
